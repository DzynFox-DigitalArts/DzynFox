        long-term goals that ultimately result in the identification and preference of your brand by
        consumers. A successful branding strategy encompasses the brand's mission, its promises to its
        customers, and how these are communicated.

        Often misconceived, a branding strategy is not the sum of your logo, colour palette, or website;
        though these creative elements are integral to a successful branding strategy. A branding strategy
        revolves around all the intangible elements that over time drive brand awareness, brand equity, and
        brand sentiment.
        
        Our steps for brand development strategy are:

        1. Considering your overall business strategy
        2. Identify your target clients
        3. Research your target client group
        4. Develop your brand positioning
        5. Develop your messaging strategy
        6. Determine the type of images to be used
        7. Develop your name, logo & tagline
        8. Develop your content marketing strategy
        9. Develop your website
        10. Build your marketing toolkit
        11. Implement, track & adjust

        Components of a comprehensive branding strategy

        1. Purpose – functional & intentional
        2. Consistency
        3. Emotion
        4. Flexibility
        5. Loyalty
        6. Competitive awareness

        Types of branding

        1. Personal branding
        2. Product branding
        3. Service branding
        4. Corporate branding
        5. Co-branding

        The best practices to building your brand
